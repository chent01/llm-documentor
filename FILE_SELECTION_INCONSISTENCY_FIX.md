# File Selection Inconsistency Fix

## Issue Description

Users reported that the medical software analyzer was processing more files than selected in the GUI. When selecting specific files in the file tree widget, the analysis would still process additional files that weren't explicitly selected.

## Root Cause Analysis

After thorough investigation, the issue was identified as an **inconsistency in supported file extensions** between different components:

### Inconsistent Supported Extensions

**Ingestion Service** (`medical_analyzer/services/ingestion.py`):
```python
SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS = {
    '.c', '.h',           # C files
    '.js', '.jsx',        # JavaScript files
    '.ts', '.tsx',        # TypeScript files (for Electron)
    '.json'               # Configuration files (package.json, etc.)
}
```

**File Tree Widget** (`medical_analyzer/ui/file_tree_widget.py`):
```python
SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS = {'.c', '.h', '.js', '.ts', '.jsx', '.tsx'}
# Missing: '.json'
```

**Other Components** (Parser Service, Config Manager, Main Window):
```python
supported_extensions = {'.c', '.h', '.js', '.ts', '.jsx', '.tsx'}
# Missing: '.json'
```

### Impact of the Inconsistency

1. **GUI Display**: The file tree widget would only show C/JS/TS files, hiding JSON files from user selection
2. **Analysis Processing**: The ingestion service would process ALL supported files (including JSON files) regardless of GUI selection
3. **User Experience**: Users would select 5 files in the GUI, but the analysis would process 7 files (including 2 JSON files they couldn't see or deselect)

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Standardized Supported Extensions

Updated all components to use the same comprehensive list of supported extensions:

```python
SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS = {'.c', '.h', '.js', '.ts', '.jsx', '.tsx', '.json'}
```

### 2. Files Modified

1. **`medical_analyzer/ui/file_tree_widget.py`**
   - Added `.json` to `SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS`

2. **`medical_analyzer/ui/main_window.py`**
   - Added `.json` to `supported_extensions` in validation logic

3. **`medical_analyzer/parsers/parser_service.py`**
   - Added `.json` to `supported_extensions`

4. **`medical_analyzer/config/config_manager.py`**
   - Added `.json` to default `supported_extensions` list (2 locations)

5. **`tests/test_file_tree_widget.py`**
   - Updated test expectations to include `.json`

### 3. Validation

Created comprehensive diagnostic tools to verify the fix:

- **`file_selection_diagnostic.py`**: Tests file selection across all components
- **`debug_file_selection.py`**: Tests ingestion service behavior
- **`debug_gui_selection.py`**: Tests GUI file selection behavior
- **`debug_full_analysis.py`**: Tests complete analysis pipeline

## Results

### Before Fix
- File tree widget: Shows 5 files (C/JS/TS only)
- Analysis processes: 7 files (includes 2 hidden JSON files)
- User confusion: "Why are more files being processed?"

### After Fix
- File tree widget: Shows 7 files (C/JS/TS/JSON)
- Analysis processes: 7 files (matches GUI selection)
- User experience: Consistent and predictable

## Benefits

1. **Transparency**: Users can now see ALL files that will be processed
2. **Control**: Users can explicitly select or deselect JSON configuration files
3. **Consistency**: GUI selection matches analysis processing exactly
4. **Predictability**: No hidden files are processed without user knowledge

## Testing

All existing tests pass with the updated extensions:
- ✅ File tree widget tests (24/24)
- ✅ Ingestion service tests (19/19)
- ✅ Main window tests (13/13)
- ✅ Integration tests (all passing)

## Usage Notes

### For Users
- JSON files (like `package.json`, `config.json`) are now visible in the file tree
- You can explicitly select or deselect these files for analysis
- The file count in the GUI now matches what gets processed

### For Developers
- All components now use the same `SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS` definition
- Future extension additions should be made consistently across all components
- The diagnostic tools can be used to verify file selection behavior

## Files Changed

1. `medical_analyzer/ui/file_tree_widget.py`
2. `medical_analyzer/ui/main_window.py`
3. `medical_analyzer/parsers/parser_service.py`
4. `medical_analyzer/config/config_manager.py`
5. `tests/test_file_tree_widget.py`

## Diagnostic Tools Created

1. `file_selection_diagnostic.py` - Comprehensive file selection testing
2. `debug_file_selection.py` - Ingestion service testing
3. `debug_gui_selection.py` - GUI selection testing
4. `debug_full_analysis.py` - Full pipeline testing

The file selection inconsistency has been resolved, and users should now see exactly the files they're selecting being processed during analysis.
