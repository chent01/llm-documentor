# Analysis Pipeline Execution Fix

## Problem
The analysis pipeline was not executing all stages properly and was jumping directly from "analysis started" to "analysis completed successfully" without going through individual stages. Additionally, any stage failure would cause the entire pipeline to stop.

## Root Causes

### 1. **Early Stage Failures Stop Entire Pipeline**
- If any stage failed (e.g., project ingestion with invalid path), the entire pipeline would stop
- No distinction between critical stages (must succeed) and optional stages (can fail)

### 2. **Poor Error Handling**
- Exceptions in stages were caught and re-raised, causing pipeline termination
- No graceful degradation for optional stages
- Limited error reporting and debugging information

### 3. **Silent Service Skipping**
- When LLM backend was unavailable, stages were silently skipped
- No clear communication about what services are available vs. unavailable
- Users couldn't understand why certain stages weren't running

## Solution

### 1. **Improved Pipeline Execution Logic**

**Before (Broken)**:
```python
def _run_analysis_pipeline(self):
    try:
        # All stages in one try-catch block
        self._run_stage("Project Ingestion", self._stage_project_ingestion, 10)
        self._run_stage("Code Parsing", self._stage_code_parsing, 20)
        # ... other stages
        
        self.analysis_completed.emit(self.current_analysis['results'])
        
    except Exception as e:
        # Any failure stops entire pipeline
        self.logger.error(f"Analysis pipeline failed: {e}")
        self.analysis_failed.emit(str(e))
    finally:
        self.is_running = False
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```python
def _run_analysis_pipeline(self):
    pipeline_errors = []
    stages_completed = 0
    total_stages = 8
    
    try:
        # CRITICAL STAGES - Must succeed for analysis to continue
        try:
            self._run_stage("Project Ingestion", self._stage_project_ingestion, 10)
            stages_completed += 1
        except Exception as e:
            error_msg = f"Critical stage 'Project Ingestion' failed: {e}"
            self.analysis_failed.emit(error_msg)
            return  # Cannot continue without project ingestion
        
        # OPTIONAL STAGES - Can fail without stopping pipeline
        if self.feature_extractor:
            try:
                self._run_stage("Feature Extraction", self._stage_feature_extraction, 40)
                stages_completed += 1
            except Exception as e:
                error_msg = f"Feature extraction failed: {e}"
                pipeline_errors.append(error_msg)
                self.stage_failed.emit("Feature Extraction", error_msg)
                # Continue with analysis - this stage is optional
        else:
            self.stage_failed.emit("Feature Extraction", "LLM backend not available")
        
        # Analysis completed (with possible warnings)
        completion_message = f"Analysis completed with {stages_completed}/{total_stages} stages successful"
        if pipeline_errors:
            self.current_analysis['results']['pipeline_errors'] = pipeline_errors
        
        self.analysis_completed.emit(self.current_analysis['results'])
```

### 2. **Stage Classification System**

**Critical Stages** (Must succeed):
- Project Ingestion - Cannot analyze without valid project
- Code Parsing - Cannot analyze without parsed code

**Optional Stages** (Can fail gracefully):
- Feature Extraction - Depends on LLM backend
- Hazard Identification - Depends on LLM backend  
- Risk Analysis - Can work with empty data
- Test Generation - Can work with basic code structure
- Traceability Analysis - Can work with available data
- Results Compilation - Always attempted

### 3. **Enhanced Error Reporting**

**Service Capability Detection**:
```python
def get_service_capabilities(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    return {
        'critical_services': {
            'project_ingestion': hasattr(self, 'ingestion_service'),
            'code_parsing': hasattr(self, 'parser_service')
        },
        'optional_services': {
            'feature_extraction': self.feature_extractor is not None,
            'hazard_identification': self.hazard_identifier is not None,
            # ... other services
        },
        'limitations': [
            "LLM backend not available - feature extraction and hazard identification will be skipped"
        ]
    }
```

**Detailed Stage Logging**:
- Each stage start/completion is logged
- Failed stages emit `stage_failed` signals with detailed error messages
- Pipeline errors are collected and included in final results
- Debug-level tracebacks for detailed error investigation

### 4. **Graceful Degradation**

**LLM-Dependent Services**:
- Feature extraction and hazard identification require LLM backend
- When unavailable, stages are skipped with clear warning messages
- Analysis continues with remaining stages

**Missing Data Handling**:
- Risk analysis works with empty hazard data
- Traceability analysis works with available features/risks
- Test generation works with basic code structure

## Verification Results

### ✅ **With Invalid Path**:
```
INFO: Starting analysis for project: /non/existent/path
INFO: Starting stage: Project Ingestion
ERROR: Critical stage 'Project Ingestion' failed: Path does not exist
```
- Pipeline stops at critical stage failure (correct behavior)
- Clear error message provided
- No false "analysis completed successfully" message

### ✅ **With Valid Path (No LLM)**:
```
INFO: Starting stage: Project Ingestion
INFO: Completed stage: Project Ingestion successfully
INFO: Starting stage: Code Parsing  
INFO: Completed stage: Code Parsing successfully
WARNING: Skipping feature extraction - LLM backend not available
WARNING: Skipping hazard identification - LLM backend not available
INFO: Starting stage: Risk Analysis
INFO: Completed stage: Risk Analysis successfully
INFO: Starting stage: Test Generation
INFO: Completed stage: Test Generation successfully
INFO: Starting stage: Traceability Analysis
INFO: Completed stage: Traceability Analysis successfully
INFO: Starting stage: Results Compilation
INFO: Completed stage: Results Compilation successfully
INFO: Analysis completed with 6/8 stages successful
```
- All available stages execute properly
- Clear warnings for skipped stages
- Accurate completion summary (6/8 stages)

## Key Improvements

- ✅ Progress updates work correctly
- ✅ No more direct jump to completion

### 2. **Robust Error Handling**
