# Test Suite Fixes Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the systematic fixing of failing unit tests across the medical software analyzer project. The current test suite has multiple failing tests across different modules including packaging, parser service, progress widget, results tab widget, SOUP service, SOUP widget, and user acceptance tests. These failures need to be resolved to ensure code quality, maintainability, and reliable continuous integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Configuration and Packaging Test Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the configuration and packaging tests to pass reliably, so that I can trust the configuration management system works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running test_config_manager_custom_path THEN the test SHALL pass without assertion errors related to backend type mismatches
2. WHEN running test_config_save_and_load THEN the test SHALL correctly save and load configuration with the expected backend type
3. WHEN running test_config_validation THEN the test SHALL properly validate configuration parameters and return expected boolean results
4. IF configuration tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific validation issue

### Requirement 2: Parser Service Error Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want parser service tests to correctly validate error handling, so that the parser behaves predictably when encountering invalid inputs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing parser service with non-existent files THEN the test SHALL raise FileNotFoundError as expected
2. WHEN parser encounters invalid file paths THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully
3. WHEN parser service error handling is tested THEN the test SHALL verify the correct exception type is raised
4. IF parser service fails to raise expected exceptions THEN the test SHALL fail with clear diagnostic information

### Requirement 3: Progress Widget Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want the progress widget to display error states and emit signals correctly, so that I can monitor analysis progress and handle errors appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN progress widget encounters an error THEN the error label SHALL be visible to the user
2. WHEN progress widget emits signals THEN the connected handlers SHALL receive the signals correctly
3. WHEN progress widget updates stage status THEN the visual indicators SHALL reflect the current state
4. IF progress widget fails to display errors THEN the system SHALL log the failure for debugging

### Requirement 4: Results Tab Widget Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the results tab widget to display test results correctly and handle user interactions, so that I can view and interact with analysis results effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN summary tab displays errors THEN the errors group SHALL be visible to users
2. WHEN user double-clicks on failed test items THEN the system SHALL handle the interaction without NameError exceptions
3. WHEN tab interaction signals are emitted THEN the connected handlers SHALL receive the expected number of signals
4. WHEN results tab widget updates THEN all required UI components SHALL be properly initialized and accessible

### Requirement 5: SOUP Service Component Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want SOUP service to properly validate and manage software components, so that component tracking works reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding components to SOUP service THEN the system SHALL generate valid IDs without validation errors
2. WHEN SOUP service validates components THEN the validation SHALL accept properly formatted component data
3. WHEN component ID generation occurs THEN the generated ID SHALL meet the required format specifications
4. IF component validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages about validation requirements

### Requirement 6: SOUP Widget Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the SOUP widget to display error messages when operations fail, so that I understand what went wrong and can take corrective action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SOUP widget refresh operations fail THEN the system SHALL display critical error messages to the user
2. WHEN SOUP widget encounters errors THEN the error handling SHALL be properly tested and verified
3. WHEN error dialogs are expected THEN the test framework SHALL correctly verify their appearance
4. IF SOUP widget error handling fails THEN the test SHALL provide clear feedback about the expected vs actual behavior

### Requirement 7: User Acceptance Test Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want user acceptance tests to run reliably in headless mode, so that automated testing can verify end-to-end functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running headless analysis tests THEN the system SHALL complete analysis without command-line argument errors
2. WHEN creating configuration files THEN the system SHALL initialize properly without usage message errors
3. WHEN user acceptance tests run THEN they SHALL use proper argument parsing and avoid sys.argv conflicts
4. IF user acceptance tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information about the failure cause

### Requirement 8: Test Framework Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test framework to provide reliable and consistent test execution, so that I can trust test results and identify real issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests import required modules THEN all necessary imports SHALL be available without NameError exceptions
2. WHEN tests mock external dependencies THEN the mocks SHALL be properly configured and behave as expected
3. WHEN tests verify UI component states THEN the assertions SHALL check the correct attributes and methods
4. WHEN tests run in CI/CD environments THEN they SHALL be deterministic and not depend on external state
