# Software Requirements Fixes Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical issues in the medical software analyzer's requirements handling, traceability matrix display, API integration, test generation workflow, and SOUP component management. The current system has several functional gaps that prevent proper requirements visualization, traceability tracking, API utilization, test case generation, and IEC 62304 compliance for SOUP components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Software Requirements GUI Display

**User Story:** As a medical device software developer, I want to view generated software requirements in the GUI, so that I can review, edit, and validate requirements directly within the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN software requirements are generated THEN the system SHALL display them in a dedicated requirements tab in the results widget
2. WHEN requirements tab is selected THEN the system SHALL show both User Requirements (URs) and Software Requirements (SRs) in an organized hierarchical view
3. WHEN viewing requirements THEN the system SHALL provide editable text fields for each requirement allowing real-time modification
4. WHEN requirements are modified THEN the system SHALL automatically save changes and update traceability links
5. IF no requirements are generated THEN the system SHALL display a clear message indicating the requirements generation status

### Requirement 2: Traceability Matrix Proper Display

**User Story:** As a medical device software developer, I want to view a properly formatted traceability matrix, so that I can verify compliance with medical device standards and identify coverage gaps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN traceability analysis completes THEN the system SHALL display the traceability matrix in a tabular format with clear column headers
2. WHEN viewing the traceability matrix THEN the system SHALL show mappings between Code → Software Requirements → User Requirements → Risks
3. WHEN traceability matrix is displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight missing links with visual indicators (red cells or warning icons)
4. WHEN user clicks on matrix cells THEN the system SHALL provide detailed information about the traced relationship
5. WHEN matrix data is available THEN the system SHALL provide export functionality to CSV and Excel formats
6. IF traceability data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and allow partial matrix viewing

### Requirement 3: API Interface Integration and Response Validation

**User Story:** As a medical device software developer, I want the system to properly utilize the /generate API endpoint and validate responses, so that generation requests are actually processed rather than just acknowledged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making requests to /generate endpoint THEN the system SHALL examine the JSON response content rather than just HTTP status codes
2. WHEN API returns 200 OK THEN the system SHALL parse the response JSON to verify actual processing occurred
3. WHEN API response indicates processing failure THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages from the response body
4. WHEN API response contains generation results THEN the system SHALL extract and display the generated content appropriately
5. WHEN API is unavailable or returns errors THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms or clear user guidance
6. IF API response format is unexpected THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 4: Test Case Generation and Export Workflow

**User Story:** As a medical device software developer, I want to generate test case outlines and export them for use in separate test projects, so that I can implement tests in my preferred testing environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test generation is requested THEN the system SHALL create test case outlines rather than executable test files
2. WHEN test cases are generated THEN the system SHALL provide structured test templates including test name, description, preconditions, test steps, and expected results
3. WHEN viewing generated test cases THEN the system SHALL display them in a copyable text format with syntax highlighting
4. WHEN user requests test export THEN the system SHALL provide multiple export formats (plain text, JSON, XML, CSV)
5. WHEN test cases are exported THEN the system SHALL organize them by requirement or feature for easy integration into external test projects
6. WHEN test generation completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of generated test cases with coverage statistics

### Requirement 5: IEC 62304 Compliant SOUP Component Management

**User Story:** As a medical device software developer, I want SOUP components to be automatically inferred from the project and managed according to IEC 62304 standards, so that I can maintain regulatory compliance for third-party software components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN project analysis runs THEN the system SHALL automatically detect SOUP components from package.json, requirements.txt, CMakeLists.txt, and other dependency files
2. WHEN SOUP components are detected THEN the system SHALL classify them according to IEC 62304 safety classifications (Class A, B, or C)
3. WHEN SOUP components are identified THEN the system SHALL provide fields for safety justification, version control, and change impact assessment
4. WHEN SOUP inventory is displayed THEN the system SHALL show component name, version, supplier, intended use, safety classification, and justification
5. WHEN SOUP components are managed THEN the system SHALL track version changes and require re-evaluation for safety impact
6. WHEN SOUP data is exported THEN the system SHALL generate IEC 62304 compliant documentation including SOUP list and safety analysis
7. IF SOUP components cannot be automatically classified THEN the system SHALL prompt user for manual classification with guidance

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Requirements Workflow Integration

**User Story:** As a medical device software developer, I want seamless integration between requirements generation, traceability, and test case creation, so that I can maintain consistency across all documentation artifacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requirements are modified THEN the system SHALL automatically update affected traceability links
2. WHEN new requirements are added THEN the system SHALL prompt for traceability mapping to existing code and risks
3. WHEN requirements change THEN the system SHALL flag affected test cases for review and regeneration
4. WHEN traceability gaps are identified THEN the system SHALL suggest potential mappings based on content similarity
5. WHEN requirements workflow completes THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive status report showing completion percentages for requirements, traceability, and test coverage

### Requirement 7: API Response Processing and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a medical device software developer, I want robust API response processing with detailed error reporting, so that I can understand and resolve generation issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL validate JSON structure against expected schemas
2. WHEN API processing fails THEN the system SHALL extract and display specific error codes and messages from the response
3. WHEN API timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
4. WHEN API rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL queue requests and provide progress feedback
5. WHEN API responses contain partial results THEN the system SHALL process available data and indicate incomplete sections
6. IF API communication fails completely THEN the system SHALL provide offline mode capabilities where possible

### Requirement 8: User Interface Enhancements for Requirements Management

**User Story:** As a medical device software developer, I want an intuitive interface for managing requirements, traceability, and SOUP components, so that I can efficiently navigate and update complex documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the requirements interface THEN the system SHALL provide search and filter capabilities across all requirements
2. WHEN managing traceability THEN the system SHALL offer drag-and-drop functionality for creating new trace links
3. WHEN working with SOUP components THEN the system SHALL provide bulk import/export capabilities for component data
4. WHEN viewing complex data THEN the system SHALL offer multiple view modes (tree view, table view, graph view)
5. WHEN making changes THEN the system SHALL provide undo/redo functionality for all user modifications
6. WHEN data is modified THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indicators of unsaved changes and validation status
