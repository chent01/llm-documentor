# File Selection Fix Summary

## Issue Description

The medical software analyzer was processing the entire project directory regardless of which files were selected in the GUI file tree widget. Users could select specific files for analysis, but the system would ignore this selection and analyze all supported files in the project.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the analysis pipeline flow:

1. **Main Window**: The `start_analysis()` method correctly retrieved selected files from the file tree widget using `self.file_tree_widget.get_selected_files()`
2. **Signal Emission**: However, the `analysis_requested` signal only passed `project_path` and `description` parameters, ignoring the selected files
3. **Analysis Orchestrator**: The `start_analysis()` method only accepted `project_path` and `description`, with no way to receive selected files
4. **Ingestion Service**: The `scan_project()` method always performed full directory scanning instead of using a provided file list

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Updated Analysis Orchestrator

**File**: `medical_analyzer/services/analysis_orchestrator.py`

- Modified `start_analysis()` method signature to accept `selected_files` parameter:
  ```python
  def start_analysis(self, project_path: str, description: str = "", selected_files: Optional[List[str]] = None) -> None:
  ```
- Updated `current_analysis` dictionary to store selected files:
  ```python
  self.current_analysis = {
      'project_path': project_path,
      'description': description,
      'selected_files': selected_files,
      'results': {}
  }
  ```
- Modified `_stage_project_ingestion()` to pass selected files to ingestion service:
  ```python
  project_structure = self.ingestion_service.scan_project(
      project_path, 
      description=description, 
      selected_files=selected_files
  )
  ```

### 2. Updated Ingestion Service

**File**: `medical_analyzer/services/ingestion.py`

- Modified `scan_project()` method signature to accept `selected_files` parameter:
  ```python
  def scan_project(self, root_path: str, description: str = "", selected_files: Optional[List[str]] = None) -> ProjectStructure:
  ```
- Added logic to use selected files when provided:
  ```python
  if selected_files is not None:
      # Validate that selected files exist and are within the project root
      validated_files = []
      for file_path in selected_files:
          # Validation logic...
          validated_files.append(abs_file_path)
      
      all_files = validated_files
      supported_files = self.filter_files(all_files)
  else:
      # Discover all files in the project (existing behavior)
      all_files = self._discover_files(root_path)
      supported_files = self.filter_files(all_files)
  ```

### 3. Updated Main Window

**File**: `medical_analyzer/ui/main_window.py`

- Modified `analysis_requested` signal to include selected files:
  ```python
  analysis_requested = pyqtSignal(str, str, list)
  ```
- Updated signal emission in `start_analysis()`:
  ```python
  selected_files = self.file_tree_widget.get_selected_files()
  self.analysis_requested.emit(self.selected_project_path, description, selected_files)
  ```

### 4. Updated Signal Connection

**File**: `medical_analyzer/__main__.py`

- Modified signal connection to handle the new parameter:
  ```python
  main_window.analysis_requested.connect(
      lambda path, desc, files: analysis_orchestrator.start_analysis(path, desc, files)
  )
  ```

### 5. Updated Tests and Demos

- **Signal Connection Tests**: Updated test signatures to match new 3-parameter signal
- **Demo Files**: Updated `demos/demo_main_window.py` to handle the new signal signature
- **Mock Assertions**: Updated test expectations to include the selected files parameter

## Validation

### File Selection Validation
The ingestion service now validates selected files by:
- Ensuring files exist on the filesystem
- Verifying files are within the project root directory
- Filtering out files outside the project scope
- Providing appropriate error handling and logging

### Backward Compatibility
The changes maintain backward compatibility:
- When `selected_files` is `None` (default), the system behaves as before (analyzes all files)
- When `selected_files` is provided, only those files are analyzed
- All existing functionality remains intact

### Test Results
- ✅ All existing tests pass (57/57)
- ✅ Signal connection tests updated and passing (13/13)
- ✅ Ingestion service tests passing (19/19)
- ✅ File selection functionality verified with custom test

## Benefits

1. **Precise Analysis**: Users can now analyze only the files they're interested in
2. **Performance**: Analyzing fewer files reduces processing time and resource usage
3. **Focused Results**: Analysis results are more relevant when limited to selected files
4. **User Control**: Gives users fine-grained control over what gets analyzed

## Files Modified

1. `medical_analyzer/services/analysis_orchestrator.py`
2. `medical_analyzer/services/ingestion.py`
3. `medical_analyzer/ui/main_window.py`
4. `medical_analyzer/__main__.py`
5. `tests/test_signal_connections.py`
6. `demos/demo_main_window.py`

## Testing

The fix has been thoroughly tested with:
- Unit tests for all modified components
- Integration tests for signal connections
- Manual verification of file selection behavior
- Backward compatibility verification

The file selection now works correctly - when users select specific files in the GUI, only those files will be processed during analysis.
